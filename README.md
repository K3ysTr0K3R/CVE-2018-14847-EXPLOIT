# CVE-2018-14847 - MikroTik WinBox File Read üí•

MikroTik RouterOS through version 6.42 is affected by a directory traversal vulnerability in the WinBox interface, allowing unauthenticated remote attackers to read arbitrary files and remote authenticated attackers to write arbitrary files. This vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2018-14847, poses a significant security risk to affected systems. The vulnerability exists due to improper input validation in the WinBox interface, which allows attackers to navigate to directories outside the WinBox sandbox. By exploiting this vulnerability, attackers can read sensitive system files, such as configuration files, usernames, passwords and even write arbitrary files to the system, potentially leading to further compromise.
